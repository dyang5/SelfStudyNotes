\section{Introduction to Fermat's Last Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Fermat's Last Theorem, 1637]
There are no positive integers $x$, $y$, $z$ that satisfy \[x^n + y^n = z^n\]
for integer $n > 2$. \\

An equivalent formulation is the one discussed in lecture:
\[
    x^n + y^n = z^n
\] where $n > 2$ is an integer, has no non-trivial solutions $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $\Q, \Z$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Diophantine Problem]
A \textbf{Diophantine problem} is a polynomial equation solved in $\Z$ and $\Q$. \\

\textit{Fermat's Last Theorem is an example of a Diophantine problem.}
\end{definition}

\textit{Historically, in 1993, Andrew Wiles published a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Later, Wiles and his student Richard Taylor rectified the 1993 proof and published
the first successful proof. For these efforts, Wiles won the 2016 Abel Prize and
the 2017 Copley Medal.} \\

With some extra background, we can prove Fermat's Last Theorem for $n = 4$.

\subsection{Parameterization of Pythagorean Triples}

\begin{theorem}[Primitive Pythagorean Triple Generation]
If $(x, y, z)$ is a \textbf{primitive} pythagorean triple\footnote{if $(x, y, z)$ is a primitive Pythagorean triple, then it follows that $x$, $y$, and $z$ are pairwise primtiive.    
} ($\nexists \, d$ such that $d \mid x$, $d\mid y$ and $d \mid z$), then $z$ is odd. Furthermore, assuming that
$x$ is odd and $y$ is even, then there exists coprime $r, s \in \Z$ with such that
\[ x = r^2 - s^2, \, y = 2rs, \, z = r^2 + s^2. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch (Theorem 3)]
Since $y$ is even, we can rewrite $y = 2y_1$ for some integer $y_1$. Since $(x, y, z)$ are a Pythagorean triple, it follows that
\( y^2 = z^2 - x^2 = (z-x)(z+x). \) Substituting and expanding, we get that 
\[
    4y_1^2 = (z-x)(z+x).
\] 
Since $x$, $z$ are both odd, we can rewrite $z-x = 2a$ and $z+x =2b$, so 
\[ y_1^2 = ab\] where $(a, b) = 1$. Consequently, $a$, $b$ must themselves be perfect squares. We conclude that $y_1=rs$, where $r^2 = a$, $s^2=b$, and so it follows that
$y = 2rs$ for coprime $r$, $s$. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Pythagorean Varieties}

\begin{definition}[Variety]
A \textbf{variety} is a set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations.
\end{definition}

Consider the variety $\mathcal{V}: x^2 + y^2 - z^2$, which is a Pythagorean variety. Note that
$\mathcal{V}(\R)$ is a structure consisting of two cones which are reflections about the $z$-axis,
and $ \mathcal{V}(\Z)$, $\mathcal{V}(\Q)$ are subsets of $\mathcal{V} (\R)$.

\begin{lemma*}
For every $\vec{v} \in \mathcal{V}(\Q)$, there exists a unique primitive $\vec{w} \in \mathcal{V}(\Z)_+^{0}$ with $\vec{w} \sim \vec{v}$, where
$\vec{u} \sim \vec{v} \iff \vec{u} = \lambda\vec{v}, \, \lambda \in \R \setminus \{ 0\}$.
\end{lemma*}

Note that $\mathcal{V}(\R)_+ / \sim$ can be thought of as $S^1$; for a point
$(x, y, z) \in \mathcal{V} (\R)_+ \mapsto \left( \frac{x}{z}, \frac{y}{z}, 1 \right)$. Furthermore, $\mathcal{V}(\R) / \sim = S^1 \cup \{0\}.$ \\

Furthermore, note that another set of representatives of $\mathcal{V} (\Q)_+ / \sim$ is $S^1(\Q)$. This gives a notion for why Pythagorean triples are fundamental:
they parameterize rational points on the unit circle. Formally, 
\[
    \left( \frac{r}{u}, \frac{t}{u} \right) \in S^1(\Q) \iff (r, t, u) \in \mathcal{V} (\Z)_+^{0} 
\]

\subsection{Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=4$}

\textbf{Statement.} $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ in $\Z$ implies $xyz = 0$. \\
\textbf{Stronger Statement.} $x^4 + y^4 = z^2$ in $\Z$ implies $xyz = 0$.
\begin{proof}
Note that if $x^4 + y^4 - z^2 = 0$, then $(x^2, y^2, z^2) \in \mathcal{V}(\Z)_+^0$, a primitive Pythagorean triple. By the Parameterization
of primitive Pythagorean triples, there exists $r, s \in \Z$ such that 
\[
  x^2 = r^2 - s^2, \, y^2 = 2rs, \, z = r^2 + s^2.  
\]
\end{proof}
